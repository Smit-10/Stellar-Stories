        <p class="capital">Leo sat on the cool grass in his backyard, his dog, Comet, snoozing beside him. Above, the
          night sky was a blanket of spilled glitter. Leo pointed his telescope at a tiny, twinkling star that looked a
          million miles away.</p>

        <p>"It is a million... and millions more miles away," said a soft voice.</p>

      <div class="inner-div2">
        <p>It was his Grandma Anya, carrying two mugs of hot chocolate. She had been an
          <strong>astrophysicist</strong>,someone who studied stars, and she knew all the secrets of the universe.
        </p>

        <p>"Grandma," Leo asked, taking a warm mug, "if I wanted to visit that star, how long would it take?"</p>
      </div>
      <img class="wormhole" src="/Images/wormhole3.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>Grandma Anya smiled. "Oh, a <strong>very, very long time</strong>. Even in the fastest spaceship we can imagine,
      it would take you longer than your whole life. Space is just that big."</p>

    <p>Leo sighed. "So, there's no shortcut?"</p>

    <p>Grandma Anya’s eyes twinkled brighter than any star. "Well, that's where things get interesting. Some very clever
      scientists, like Albert Einstein, imagined a special kind of shortcut. A secret passage through space. They called
      it a <strong>wormhole</strong>."</p>

    <p>Comet the dog lifted one floppy ear. The word sounded like "worm."</p>

    <p>"A wormhole?" Leo giggled. "Like a hole a worm digs?"</p>

    <p>"<strong>Exactly like that!</strong>" Grandma Anya said, her smile widening. She picked an apple from the small
      tree in their garden. "Imagine this apple is the entire universe. Your star is on this side," she said, pointing
      to the top, "and we are way over here," she pointed to the bottom.</p>

    <p>"Now, if you were a tiny ant, you would have to walk all the way around the apple's skin to get from one side to
      the other. That’s <strong>the long way</strong>."</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <img class="wormhole" src="/Images/wormhole4.png" alt="">
      <div class="inner-div3">
        <p>She traced a long path around the apple with her finger.</p>

        <p>"<strong>But</strong>," she continued, "what if you were a little worm? You wouldn't walk on the
          outside.You'd be much smarter. You would chew a tunnel <strong>straight through the middle!</strong>"</p>

        <p>She poked her finger from the bottom of the apple right through to the top. "See? A shortcut! A wormhole is
          like that tunnel. It’s a theoretical tunnel that connects two very, very distant places in space, letting you
          travel between them <strong>almost instantly</strong>."</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Leo’s eyes were wide with wonder. "So space can... <strong>fold?</strong>"</p>

    <p>"That's the idea!" Grandma Anya took a napkin and drew a dot on one end and another on the other. "Here's you,
      and here's the star. The long way is to travel across the napkin."</p>

    <p>Then, she did something magical. She folded the napkin in half, bringing the two dots right next to each other.
      She poked her pen through both dots at once.</p>

    <p>"A wormhole," she whispered, "<strong>brings the destination to you</strong>."</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div4">
        <p>Leo stared at the hole in the napkin, then back up at the sky. He imagined a shimmering, swirling tunnel
          opening up near his backyard, glowing with the colours of a rainbow. He saw himself and Comet floating through
          it, stars and galaxies whizzing past the window of their spaceship like colourful streaks of paint. They would
          pop out on the other side in just a few minutes, ready to explore a whole new solar system.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="wormhole" src="/Images/wormhole5.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>"Are they real, Grandma?" Leo asked, his voice full of hope.</p>

    <p>"<strong>We haven't found one yet</strong>," she said softly. "For now, they live in our stories and our math
      equations. But the universe is <strong>full of surprises</strong>. Who knows? Maybe one day, a brave explorer like
      you will be the first to travel through one."</p>

    <p>Leo looked at the distant, twinkling star again. It didn't seem so far away anymore. It seemed like a destination
      waiting for its first visitor, just a <strong>cosmic shortcut away</strong>. He hugged his grandma, his mind
      buzzing with wormholes, folded space, and starry adventures.</p>
