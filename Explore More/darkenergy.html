    <p class="capital">Hello, Cosmic Chefs! Today, we're going to follow the universe's secret recipe. You might think the universe is
      mostly made of shiny stars, swirling galaxies, and cool planets like ours. But that's just the glittery sprinkles
      on top! The two biggest ingredients are invisible, mysterious, and have very spooky names: <strong>Dark
        Matter</strong> and <strong>Dark Energy</strong>.</p>

    <p>Let's put on our aprons and see what they do!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredient 1: The Invisible Glue (Dark Matter) ðŸŒŒ</h3>
    <div class="inner-div">
    <div class="inner-div1">
    <p>First, we need to build everything. Imagine you have a huge box of sparkling LEGOs. These are your stars,
      planets, and gas clouds. You try to build a giant, spinning galaxy, but the pieces just won't stick together. As
      soon as you spin it, the LEGOs fly all over the room! Itâ€™s a mess.</p>
    <p>This is where you add your first secret ingredient: <strong>Dark Matter</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="darkenergy" src="/Images/darkenergy2.jpg" alt="Dark Matter">
    </div>

    <p>You can't see this ingredient. It's not black or grey; it's completely <strong>invisible</strong>. It doesn't
      taste like anything or smell like anything. But when you mix it in with your LEGOs, it acts like a super-strong,
      invisible glue.</p>

    <p>Now, when you build your galaxy and give it a spin, all the stars stay perfectly in place, twirling around in a
      beautiful spiral. Dark Matter is the silent helper that <strong>holds everything together</strong>. Scientists
      know it's there not because they can see it, but because without it, all the galaxies would have flown apart a
      long, long time ago. It's the universe's invisible framework.</p>

    <p>So, Dark Matter is the cosmic glue that pulls things together and builds the beautiful structures we see in
      space.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredient 2: The Cosmic Puffer (Dark Energy) ðŸŽˆ</h3>

    <p>Great! Our galaxy is built and isn't falling apart. But now for the next step. Our recipe says the whole universe
      needs to get bigger... and bigger... <strong>and faster!</strong></p>

    <p>This is where the second secret ingredient comes in: <strong>Dark Energy</strong>.</p>
    <div class="inner-div">
    <img class="darkenergy" src="/Images/darkenergy3.jpg" alt="Dark energy">
    <div class="inner-div2">
    <p>Imagine the dough for our universe is like a giant loaf of raisin bread baking in the oven. The raisins are the
      galaxies we just built with our Dark Matter glue. When you put the loaf in to bake, the dough starts to rise and
      expand.</p>

    <p>Dark Energy is like the yeast in the dough, but it's a very special, hyperactive kind of yeast. It doesn't just
      make the dough rise; it makes it rise <strong>faster and faster and faster!</strong> Every bit of empty space in
      the bread (the universe) is filled with this puffing power.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The raisins near each other don't move apart too much, but the raisins on opposite ends of the loaf start
      speeding away from each other as more and more dough puffs up between them. That's exactly what Dark Energy does.
      Itâ€™s an invisible force that <strong>pushes everything apart</strong>, causing the whole universe to expand at an
      accelerating rate.</p>

    <p>So, Dark Energy is the mysterious puff that pushes the universe apart, making it bigger all the time.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>The Final Dish!</h3>
    <div class="inner-div">
    <div class="inner-div3">
    <p>So, there you have it! Our universe is a strange and wonderful cosmic cake.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Only about <strong>5%</strong> is the stuff we can see (stars, planets, you, me). This is the decorative icing
        and sprinkles.</li>
      <li>About <strong>27%</strong> is Dark Matter, the invisible glue holding it all together.</li>
      <li>A whopping <strong>68%</strong> is Dark Energy, the mysterious force pushing it all apart.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The two biggest ingredients are ones we can't even see! Isn't that the most deliciously mysterious recipe you've
      ever heard of? Happy baking, Cosmic Chefs!</p>
