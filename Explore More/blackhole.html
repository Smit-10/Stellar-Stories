    <p>Ava and her friends were on a night sky camp organized by the school. They were lying on soft blankets on a hill,
      staring up at the sparkling sky.</p>

    <p>“Look at all those stars!” Ava said, pointing excitedly.</p>

    <p>Her friend, Ravi, shivered. “Some stars are so far away, it’s like they’re in another world!”</p>

    <p>Just then, their guide, Mr. Orion, who loved teaching about space, crouched beside them. “Have you ever heard of
      a <strong>black hole</strong>?” he asked.</p>

    <p>Ava shook her head. “No… what’s that?”</p>
    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div1">
    <p>Mr. Orion smiled and held a small dark ball from his backpack. “A black hole is like a <strong>giant cosmic
        vacuum cleaner</strong>, but much stronger than anything on Earth. Imagine a star that was <strong>super
        huge</strong>. When it reaches the end of its life, it can <strong>collapse under its own weight</strong>,
      shrinking smaller and smaller… until it becomes a black hole.”</p>
      <p>Ravi’s eyes went wide. “So… it just disappears?”</p>

    <p>“Not exactly,” Mr. Orion said. “A black hole doesn’t swallow everything in the universe, just what comes too
      close. Its gravity is so strong that <strong>even light can’t escape!</strong>”</p>

    <p>Ava leaned forward. “Even light? But <strong>how can we see it then?</strong>”</p>

    <p>“That’s the cool part,” Mr. Orion said, pointing to a glowing ring around the ball. “<strong>We can’t see a black
        hole directly</strong>, but we can see how it affects everything nearby. Stars and gas swirl around it, and
      that’s how we know it’s there.”</p>

    <p>Ava imagined herself floating in space, watching a black hole swirl like a giant cosmic whirlpool, stars spinning
      around it like a merry-go-round.</p>

      <div class="inner-div2">
    <p>“So black holes aren’t just scary,” she said, “they’re like <strong>space mysteries waiting to be
        explored!</strong>”</p>

    <p>Mr. Orion nodded. “Exactly! Scientists are still learning about them, and who knows — maybe one of you will
      discover something new about black holes one day.”</p>

    <p>Ava looked up at the night sky again. Somewhere out there, among billions of stars, a black hole was quietly
      <strong>bending space and time</strong> — a cosmic secret she was determined to understand.</p>
