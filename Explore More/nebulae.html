    <p class="capital">Zara and her little brother, Leo, were on a night camping trip with their astronomy club. They
      lay on the soft grass, staring at the sky as the stars twinkled like glitter scattered across a dark velvet
      blanket.</p>

    <p>“Look at that colorful cloud over there!” Leo pointed to a faint, glowing patch in the sky.</p>
    
    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div1">
    <p>Their guide, Captain Nova, who was dressed like a space explorer, smiled. “Ah, you’ve spotted a
      <strong>nebula</strong>!”</p>

    <p>“A nebula?” Zara asked, sitting up. “What’s that?”</p>

    <p>Captain Nova knelt beside them and pulled out a bright, swirling scarf from his backpack. “A nebula is like a
      giant cosmic cloud made of gas and dust. Some nebulae are the <strong>birthplaces of stars</strong>, while others
      are the <strong>remnants of stars that have exploded</strong>.”</p>
    <p>Leo’s eyes went wide. “So <strong>stars come from clouds?</strong>”</p>

    </div>

    <p>“Yes!” Captain Nova nodded. “Imagine this scarf is a nebula. Tiny particles inside it stick together over
      millions of years, and eventually, a star is born right in the middle of the cloud. Nebulae are like the
      <strong>nurseries of the universe!</strong>”</p>

    <p>Zara twirled the scarf in her hands. “Wow… so these colorful clouds are full of new stars waiting to shine?”</p>
    
    <div class="inner-div">
    <img class="nebulae" src="/Images/nebulae1.jpg" alt="Nebulae">
    <div class="inner-div2">
    <p>“Exactly,” said Captain Nova. “Some nebulae glow because of the light from young stars inside them, while others
      shine because they reflect the light of nearby stars. They come in all shapes and colors — pink, blue, purple —
      like <strong>cosmic paintings</strong>.”</p>

    <p>Leo leaned back and imagined floating through the nebula, colorful clouds swirling all around him, new stars
      sparkling like diamonds.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>“Space is full of wonders,” Captain Nova said, looking up at the sky. “And nebulae are some of the most
      beautiful. Who knows — maybe one day, one of you will discover a brand new nebula in the universe!”</p>

    <p>Zara smiled, hugging Leo. “I want to see them all… every glowing cloud, every new star. The universe is like a
      <strong>giant art gallery!</strong>”</p>
