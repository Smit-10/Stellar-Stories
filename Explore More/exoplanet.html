      <p class="capital">Lily and her dad, Mr. Carter, were on a vacation in the mountains, far away from city lights. At night, they
        sat on a blanket outside their cabin, gazing up at the sky full of twinkling stars.</p>

      <p>“Dad,” Lily asked, pointing at a bright star, “do stars have planets like Earth around them?”</p>
      
      <div class="inner-div">

      <div class="inner-div1">
      <p>Mr. Carter smiled and handed her a small telescope. “Yes, Lily! Planets that orbit stars outside our solar
        system are called <strong>exoplanets</strong>. There are <strong>thousands of them</strong>, and they’re all
        different, just like people.”</p>

      <p>Lily’s eyes widened. “Thousands? Are they big like Jupiter or small like Mercury?”</p>

      <p>“<strong>All kinds of sizes!</strong>” said Mr. Carter. “Some are giant gas planets, even bigger than Jupiter.
        Others are rocky, like Earth. Some are too hot, some are freezing cold, and some might even have water — who
        knows, <strong>maybe even life!</strong>”</p>

      <p>Lily imagined herself in a spaceship, zooming from one exoplanet to another. One planet was pink and shiny,
        another had purple skies, and one had rings like Saturn.</p>

      <p>“Wow,” Lily whispered. “So there’s a <strong>whole universe of planets out there waiting to be
          explored?</strong>”</p>

      <p>“Exactly,” said Mr. Carter, smiling. “Astronomers use telescopes and space missions to find these exoplanets.
        Sometimes they see them when the planet passes in front of its star, <strong>blocking a tiny bit of the star’s
          light</strong>. That’s how they know the planet is there.”</p>
        
      <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div2">
      <p>Lily looked through the telescope and imagined herself visiting a new world, discovering mountains, oceans, and
        alien skies. “Dad, I want to be an explorer and <strong>find new exoplanets someday!</strong>”</p>

      <p>Mr. Carter laughed. “With curiosity like yours, Lily, maybe you will. The universe is huge and full of
        surprises, and exoplanets are just one of its <strong>amazing mysteries</strong>.”</p>

      <p>Lily snuggled closer to her dad, her eyes sparkling like the stars above, dreaming of all the incredible worlds
        waiting to be discovered.</p>
