    <p class="capital">Lily lived in a cozy cabin tucked away where the air was crisp and the snow sparkled like crushed
      diamonds. Her favorite part about living there wasn't the sledding or the hot cocoa – it was the night sky.
      Especially when it danced!</p>
    <div class="inner-div">
      <img class="auroraImg" src="Images/aurora1.jpg" alt="Aurora">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>One chilly evening, as Lily looked out her window, she saw it. First, a faint green glow, like a shy curtain
          opening in the darkness. Then, WHOOSH! Ribbons of emerald green, ruby red, and sapphire blue began to swirl
          and sway across the sky. It looked like a giant, invisible artist was painting with the brightest colors
          imaginable!
        </p>
        <p>"Grandpa!" Lily gasped, "What is that amazing light show?"</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Grandpa smiled, his eyes twinkling like the stars themselves. "Ah, Lily-bug, that's the <strong>Aurora</strong>!
      Some people call them the <strong>Northern Lights</strong>, or the <strong>Southern Lights</strong>, depending on
      where you are on Earth. It's the sky's secret paintbrush, and it's all thanks to our amazing Sun!"</p>

    <p>Lily tilted her head. "The Sun? But it's dark!"</p>

    <p>"That's right," Grandpa explained. "Even though the Sun is far away and we can't see it at night, it's always
      busy! It's like a giant, bubbling cauldron of hot gases. Sometimes, little super-fast pieces of the Sun – tiny
      invisible sparkles called <strong>charged particles</strong> – get flung off into space. They zoom away from the
      Sun like tiny space race cars!"</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>He continued, "Most of the time, Earth has a special invisible shield around it, like a giant hug, that
          protects us from these solar race cars. But near the very top and very bottom of our Earth – close to the
          <strong>North Pole</strong> and the <strong>South Pole</strong> – our shield is a little bit thinner, almost
          like an open door."</p>
        <p>"So, what happens then?" Lily asked, completely captivated as a new wave of purple light shimmered into view.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img class="auroraImg " src="Images/aurora2.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>"Well," Grandpa whispered, "when those super-fast, charged particles from the Sun reach Earth near the poles,
      they zoom right into our sky! Up, up, up they go, until they bump right into the tiny air particles that make up
      our <strong>atmosphere</strong> – the air we breathe!"</p>

    <p>"It's like they're playing cosmic tag!" Lily exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Exactly!" Grandpa chuckled. "And when these solar particles tag our air particles, they get super excited! When
      they get excited, they let out a little burst of light. And because there are so many of them, and they're all
      bumping and tagging our air, they create these amazing, flowing curtains of color across the sky!"</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <img class="auroraImg" src="Images/aurora3.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>He pointed. "See how it's mostly green? That's when the Sun's particles bump into <strong>oxygen</strong> in the air. If they bump into <strong>nitrogen</strong>, we might see purples or blues. And if they hit oxygen really high up, they can make beautiful reds!"</p>

        <p>Lily watched, mesmerized, as the lights danced, swirling and changing like a silent, grand ballet. It was like the Sun was sending Earth a secret, colorful message, and the air was dancing with joy as it delivered it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>"It's like Earth is getting a hug from the Sun," Lily said, "and the hug makes the sky glow!"</p>

    <p>Grandpa nodded. "That's a perfect way to think of it, Lily-bug. A magnificent, colorful hug that reminds us how
      connected everything in our universe truly is."</p>

    <p>And as the last emerald ribbon faded into the starlit night, Lily knew she'd never forget the sky's secret
      paintbrush, bringing vibrant magic from the distant Sun right to her own backyard.</p>
