      Leo was ten years old, and he loved looking at the night sky. One night, something amazing happened. The sky above his town lit up with wavy, glowing ribbons of green and purple light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wow!" he shouted. "Mom, the sky is dancing!"
    </p>

          His mom, Anya, came to the window. "It's beautiful, Leo," she said, hugging him. "Itâ€™s called an aurora. It usually only happens way up north, near the North Pole."
        </p>
        <p>
          Leo felt special, like the sky was putting on a show just for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, something strange happened. Flicker... flicker... POP! All the lights in their house went out. Leo's video game screen went black. Outside, all the streetlights and the lights in his neighbors' houses disappeared too. It was suddenly very, very dark. The only light came from the dancing colors in the sky.
        </p>

    <p>
      "What happened?" Leo asked, a little scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," his mom said, finding a flashlight, "that the Sun just had a giant sneeze."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leo giggled. "The Sun can't sneeze!"
    </p>
    
    <p>"Well, kind of," she explained. "Imagine the Sun is a big, bubbling ball of hot gas. Sometimes, it has a huge burp or a sneeze, and it throws a big cloud of tiny sun-particles out into space. We call it a CME, or Coronal Mass Ejection."</p>

    <p>
      Anya drew a picture for him. "That cloud of sun-stuff has been flying through space for a few days, and it just hit Earth. Our planet has an invisible shield around it, like a superhero's force field. When the sun-sneeze hit our shield, it shook it really hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that shaking made the pretty lights?" Leo asked.
    </p>
    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>
          "Exactly!" his mom said. "That's the aurora. But all that shaking also jiggled the power lines that bring electricity to our homes. The lines got so jiggled that they had to turn off to take a rest. That's why our lights are out."
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next few days, there was no electricity. Leo couldn't play video games or watch TV. Instead, they ate dinner by candlelight and told stories. He played board games with his dad. During the day, since no one could stay inside and watch TV, all the kids in the neighborhood went outside to play in the park.

    <p>
      It was different, but it was also fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leo learned that the Sun wasn't just a friendly light in the sky. It was a powerful star that could create beautiful light shows and even turn off a whole city with one giant sneeze from 93 million miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the power finally came back on with a happy hum, and the TV flickered to life, Leo was excited. But he would never forget the days of the Sun's giant sneeze and the magical, dancing lights in the dark.
