    <p class="capital">Leo loved looking up at the night sky. He wasn't just looking for the moon; he was looking for
      magic! His grandma had told him that sometimes, if you were very lucky, the sky would put on a special show, like
      a sprinkle of sparkling diamonds.</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <img class="meteorImg" src="Images/meteor1.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>One warm summer evening, Leo and his grandma were snuggled on a big blanket in their backyard. The stars were
          out, tiny pinpricks of light on a giant, dark blanket. Grandma pointed to a part of the sky.</p>

        <p>"Tonight, Leo," she whispered, "we might see the sky sprinkling diamonds. It's called a <strong>meteor
            shower</strong>."</p>

        <p>Leo's eyes grew wide. "Diamonds? From space?"</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Grandma smiled. "Well, not exactly diamonds from a jewelry store. Imagine a giant cosmic road trip! Far, far
      away, there are giant space snowballs called <strong>comets</strong>. As these comets travel around the sun, they
      leave behind a trail of tiny little bits – like dust, pebbles, and small rocks. We call these tiny space travelers
      <strong>meteoroids</strong>."
    </p>

    <p>She continued, "It’s like a super long, dusty cosmic highway! Every year, our Earth travels through some of these
      dusty comet trails. It’s like driving a car through a cloud of glittering cosmic glitter!"</p>

    <p>Leo giggled, imagining Earth driving a big space car.</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>"When these tiny meteoroids get close to Earth," Grandma explained, "our planet's invisible shield, called
          the <strong>atmosphere</strong>, grabs onto them. It's like jumping into a swimming pool! As they zoom faster
          and faster through the air, they get super, super hot!"
        </p>

        <p>"Do they melt?" Leo asked, fascinated.</p>

        <p>"They burn up!" Grandma said. "And as they burn, they create a beautiful streak of light across the sky. We
          call those streaks of light <strong>shooting stars</strong>!"</p>
      </div>
      <img class="meteorImg" src="Images/meteor2.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>Just then, a bright, quick line of light zipped across the dark canvas above them.</p>

    <p>"Look!" Leo shouted, pointing a tiny finger. "A shooting star!"</p>

    <p>Another one followed, and then another! It was like the sky was showing off, drawing luminous lines with an
      invisible crayon. Each streak was a tiny meteoroid, giving its last sparkly goodbye as it zipped through Earth's
      air.</p>

    <p>"Each one of those," Grandma said softly, "is a little piece of space dust, no bigger than a grain of sand or a
      tiny pebble, putting on a spectacular show just for us."</p>

    <p>Leo watched, enchanted, as more and more shooting stars appeared. It wasn't just one or two; it was a shower! The
      sky was truly sprinkling diamonds, shimmering and dancing, each one a tiny burning message from the far reaches of
      space.</p>

      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>He made a wish on every single one. He wished he could always remember this magical night, and how tiny pieces of space dust could make the biggest, most beautiful show on Earth. And as he drifted off to sleep under the starlit sky, he knew he'd never look at a "shooting star" the same way again.</p>

        <p>They weren't just lights; they were <strong>cosmic messengers</strong>, bringing sparks from the dusty highways of space right to his own backyard.</p>
