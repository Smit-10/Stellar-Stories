    <p class="capital">Far, far away, in a swirling, sparkling neighborhood of space called a galaxy, lived a star named
      Stella.</p>

    <p>Stella wasn't just any star. She was a supergiant! While most stars were like little campfires, Stella was like a
      giant, roaring bonfire, shining with a brilliant blue-white light. For millions and millions of years, Stella did
      what all stars do best: she twinkled and shone, warming the space around her.</p>

      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>Inside her core, Stella had a magical cosmic kitchen. Her job was to take the simplest ingredient in the
          universe, a gas called hydrogen, and cook it into something new, called helium. This cooking process released
          a huge amount of energy, which is what made her shine so brightly!</p>
        <p>As Stella got older, she became a master chef. She learned to cook helium into even heavier things, like the
          carbon that makes up the pencils you draw with and the oxygen you breathe!</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>After a very, very long and happy life, Stella started to feel… different. She had used up most of her fuel. She
      had grown bigger and bigger, turning a beautiful shade of red. She knew her time as a shining star was coming to
      an end. But Stella wasn't sad. She knew she had one last, amazing gift to give to the universe.</p>

    <p>She gathered all of her energy, all of her light, and all of her power for one final, spectacular moment.</p>

    <p><strong>WHOOSH!</strong></p>

    <p>In a flash brighter than a trillion lightning bolts, Stella exploded! This amazing explosion is called a
      <strong>Supernova</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>For a few weeks, Stella's grand finale was so bright that she outshone her entire home galaxy! She was the most
      brilliant thing in the entire universe, a firework of dazzling colors—pinks, blues, oranges, and golds—stretching
      for light-years across space.</p>

    <div class="inner-div">
      <div class="inner-div1">
        <p>But this wasn't just a big flash. The explosion was so powerful, so hot, and so strong that it did something truly magical. Inside that incredible blast of energy, new, super-special elements were created.</p>

        <p>Stella’s supernova forged sparkling gold for rings and treasures, strong iron to build planets and spaceships, and even rare uranium that can power cities on Earth.</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p>Her stardust, full of all these amazing new ingredients, flew out into space. This magical dust cloud, called a
      <strong>nebula</strong>, floated through the cosmos like a beautiful, glittering promise.
    </p>

    <p>Over millions of years, this stardust will be gathered up by gravity. It will clump together to form new baby
      stars, new planets, and maybe, just maybe, new worlds where kids just like you can look up at the night sky and
      wonder about the stars.</p>

    <p>So, the next time you see a piece of gold jewelry or even just look at your own hand, remember Stella. A little
      piece of her stardust, her spectacular, generous gift to the universe, is a part of everything around you, and
      even a part of you!</p>

    <p>The death of a massive star isn't an end—it's the universe's way of planting a garden for the future.</p>
